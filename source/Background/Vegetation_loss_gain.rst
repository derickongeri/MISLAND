Vegetation Loss/Gain hotspots
=============================

Land degradation hotsports (LDH) are produced via the analysis of time-series vegetation indices data and are used to characterize areas of different sizes, where the vegetation cover and the soil types are severely degraded.

Vegetation loss/gain hotspots will be calculated based on time series observation of selected suit of vegetation indices depending on the climatic zones and terrain morphology of the North African countries. The selected indices derived from Landsat data are as listed below:

    -NDVI for humid zones, sub-humid and semi-arid zones
    -MSAVI2 for arid and stepic zones
    -SAVI for desert areas
