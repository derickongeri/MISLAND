Sustainable Development Goal 15.3 intends to combat desertification, restore 
degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and 
floods, and strive to achieve a land degradation-neutral world by 2030. In 
order to assess the progress to this goal, the agreed-upon indicator for SDG 
15.3 (proportion of land area degraded) is a combination of three 
sub-indicators: change in land productivity, change in land cover and change  
in soil organic carbon.

To select the methods and datasets to calculate these indicators, indicators 
click on the calculator icon highlighted above. This will open up the 
"Calculate Indicators" dialog box.

There are several options for calculating the SDG 15.3.1 Indicator. 
MISLAND supports calculating the indicator using the same process as was 
used by the UNCCD for the default data provided to countries for the 2018 
reporting process. The tool also supports customizing this data, or even 
replacing individual datasets with national-level or other global datasets.

- To calculate all three SDG 15.3.1 indicators in one step, using default 
  settings for most of the indicators, click "Calculate all three indicators in 
  one step".

- To calculate one of the three SDG 15.3.1 indicators, using customized 
  settings, or national-level data, click "Productivity", "Land cover", or 
  "Soil organic carbon".

- To calculate a summary table showing statistics on each of the three 
  indicators, click "Calculate final SDG 15.3.1 indicator and summary table". 
  Note that you must first compute the indicators using one of the above 
  options.
  
- To calculate a summary table showing statistics on each of the three 
  indicators for multiple sub-divisions, click "Calculate area summaries of a raster on sub-units". 
  Note that you must first compute the indicators using one of the above 
  options.

There are three different indicators that are combined to create the SDG 15.3.1 
indicator

- Productivity: measures the trajectory, performance and state of primary 
  productivity

- Land cover: calculates land cover change relative to a baseline period, enter 
  a transition matrix indicating which transitions indicate degradation, 
  stability or improvement.

- Soil carbon: compute changes in soil organic carbon as a consequence of 
  changes in land cover.

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-15-3-1` section of this manual for a detailed 
    explanation of how each of these sub-indicators is computed in 
    MISLAND

There are two ways to calculate the indicators: 1) using a simplified tool that 
will calculate all three indicators at once, but with limited options for 
customization, or 2) using individual tools for each indicator that offer 
complete control over how they are calculated.

Calculate productivity
______________________

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-productivity` background information in this 
    manual for a detailed explanation of how productivity is computed.

Productivity measures the trajectory, performance and state of primary 
productivity using either 8km AVHRR, 250m MODIS or 30m LANDSAT 7 (under development) datasets. The user can select 
one or multiple indicators to calculate, the NDVI dataset, name the tasks and 
enter in explanatory notes for their intended reporting area.

Productivity Trajectory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trajectory assesses the rate of change of productivity over time. To calculate 
trajectory:

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-productivity-trajectory` section in this 
    manual for a detailed explanation of this indicator is computed.

1) Select an indicator to calculate

2) Select NDVI dataset to use and select Next

.. note::
    The valid date range is set by the NDVI dataset selected within the first 
    tab: AVHRR dates compare 1982-2015 and MODIS 2001-2016.

.. image:: /_static/documentation/calculate/image029.png
   :align: center

3) In the tab "Advanced", select the method to be used to compute the 
   productivity trajectory analysis. The options are:

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-productivity-climate-correction` information 
    in this manual for a more detailed explanation of each of these 
    calculations.

* **NDVI trend**: This dataset shows the trend in annually integrated NDVI time 
  series (2001-2015) using MODIS (250m) dataset (MOD13Q1) or AVHRR (8km; 
  GIMMS3g.v1). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is the ratio 
  of the difference between near-infrared band (NIR) and the red band (RED) and 
  the sum of these two bands (Rouse et al., 1974; Deering 1978) and reviewed in 
  Tucker (1979). 


* **RUE**: is defined as the ratio between net primary production (NPP), in 
  this case annual integrals of NDVI, and rainfall. It has been increasingly 
  used to analyze the variability of vegetation production in arid and 
  semi-arid biomes, where rainfall is a major limiting factor for plant growth


* **RESTREND**: this method attempts to adjust the NDVI signals from the effect 
  of particular climatic drivers, such as rainfall or soil moisture, using a 
  pixel-by-pixel linear regression on the NDVI time series and the climate 
  signal. The linear model and the climatic data is used then to predict NDVI, 
  and to compute the residuals between the observed and climate-predicted NDVI 
  annual integrals. The NDVI residual trend is finally plotted to spatially 
  represent overall trends in primary productivity independent of climate. 

* **WUE**: is defined as the ratio between net primary production (NPP), in 
  this case annual integrals of NDVI, and evapotranspiration.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Performance is a comparison of how productivity in an area compares to 
productivity in similar areas at the same point in time. To calculate 
performance:

1) Select the start and end year of the period of analysis  for comparison. 

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-productivity-performance` section in this 
    manual for a detailed explanation of this indicator is computed.

Productivity State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
State performs a comparison of how current productivity in an area compares to 
past productivity. To calculate state:

1) Define the baseline and comparison periods for the computation of the State 
   sub-indicator.

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-productivity-state` section in this manual for 
    a detailed explanation of this indicator is computed.

The next step is to define the study area on which to perform the analysis. The 
tool allows selecting the area of interest in one of two ways:

1. Selects first (i.e. country) and/or second (i.e. province or state) 
   administrative boundary from a drop-down menu. 

2. The user can provide a shapefile, KML, or geojson defining an area of 
   interest. Once this is done, Select Next.

.. image:: /_static/documentation/calculate/image031.png

Calculate land cover
____________________

Changes in land cover is one of the indicators used to track potential land 
degradation which need to be reported to the UNCCD and to track progress 
towards SDG 15.3.1. While some land cover transitions indicate, in most cases, 
processes of land degradation, the interpretation of those transitions are for 
the most part context specific. For that reason, this indicator requires the 
input of the user to identify which changes in land cover will be considered as 
degradation, improvement or no change in terms of degradation. The toolbox 
allows users to calculate land cover change relative to a baseline period, 
enter a transition matrix indicating which transitions indicate degradation, 
stability or improvement.

.. note::
    Refer to the :ref:`indicator-land-cover` background information in this 
    manual for a detailed explanation of how land cover change is computed.

To calculate the land cover change indicator:

1. Click on the Calculate Indicators button from the toolbox bar, then select 
   Land cover.
   
.. image:: /_static/documentation/calculate/image033.png
   :align: center

2. Within the "Land Cover Setup tab" the user selects the baseline and target years

.. image:: /_static/documentation/calculate/image034.png
   :align: center
   
3. The land cover aggregation can be customized using the 'Edit definition' 
   button. The user can define their own aggregation of land cover classes from 
   the 37 ESA land cover classes to the 7 UNCCD categories.

   A. Select the dial button for the "Custom" option and select "Create new 
      definition" 

   B. Edit the aggregation suitable for the area of interest

   C. Select "Save definition" and select Next

.. image:: /_static/documentation/calculate/image035.png
   :align: center
   
4. Within the "Define Degradation tab" user define the meaning of each land 
   cover transition in terms of degradation. The options are: stable (0), 
   degradation (-) or improvement (+). For example, the default for cropland to 
   cropland is 0 because the land cover stays the same and is therefore stable. 
   The default for forest to cropland is -1 because forest is likely cut to 
   clear way for agriculture and would be considered deforestation. The user is 
   encouraged to thoroughly evaluate the meaning of each transition based on 
   their knowledge of the study area, since this matrix will have an important 
   effect on the land degradation identified by this subindicator.

   Users can keep the default values or create unique transition values of 
   their own.

Compute Vegatation Indices
____________________________

Land degradation hotspots (LDH) are produced via the analysis of time-series
vegetation indices data and are used to characterize areas of different sizes, 
where the vegetation cover and the soil types are severely degraded. Vegetation 
loss/gain hotspots will be calculated based on time series observation of selected 
suit of vegetation indices depending on the climatic zones and terrain morphology 
of the North African countries 

Vegation Indices computed from Landsat 7 ETM+ include:

1. **NDVI (humid, sub-humid and semi-arid zones)**

   DVI is preferable for global vegetation monitoring since it helps to compensate for 
   changes in lighting conditions, surface slope, exposure, and other external factors.
   NDVI is calculated in accordance with the formula: 

   .. image:: /_static/documentation/calculate/ndvi.png
      :align: center

   NIR – reflection in the near-infrared spectrum 
   RED – reflection in the red range of the spectrum 

   According to this formula, the density of vegetation (NDVI) at a certain point of the 
   image is equal to the difference in the intensities of reflected light in the red and 
   infrared range divided by the sum of these intensities. 

   This index defines values ​​from -1.0 to 1.0, basically representing greens, where negative 
   values ​​are mainly formed from clouds, water and snow, and values ​​close to zero are 
   primarily formed from rocks and bare soil. Very small values ​​(0.1 or less) of the NDVI 
   function correspond to empty areas of rocks, sand or snow. Moderate values ​​(from 0.2 to 0.3) 
   represent shrubs and meadows, while large values ​​(from 0.6 to 0.8) indicate temperate and 
   tropical forests. 

2. **MSAVI2 (arid and stepic zones)**

   MSAVI2 is soil adjusted vegetation indices that seek to address some of the limitation of 
   NDVI when applied to areas with a high degree of exposed soil surface.It eliminates the need 
   to find the soil line from a feature-space plot or even explicitly specify the soil brightness 
   correction factor: 

   .. image:: /_static/documentation/calculate/msavi2.png
      :align: center


3. **SAVI (desert areas)**

   SAVI is used to correct Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the influence of 
   soil brightness in areas where vegetative cover is low. Landsat Surface Reflectance-derived 
   SAVI is calculated as a ratio between the R and NIR values with a soil brightness correction 
   factor (L) defined as 0.5 to accommodate most land cover types.

   .. image:: /_static/documentation/calculate/savi.png
      :align: center

To compute the above vegetation indices, click on the calculator icon . This will open up the 
“Calculate Indicators” dialog box.

Compute Forest Fires
______________________

Burnt areas and forest fires are be highlighted and mapped out form remotely sensed **Landsat 8 /Sentinel 2**
data using the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). NBR is designed to highlight burned areas and estimate burn 
severity. It uses near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) wavelengths. Before fire events, 
healthy vegetation has very high NIR reflectance and a low SWIR reflectance. In contrast, recently 
burned areas show low reflectance in the NIR and high reflectance in the SWIR band. 

The NBR is be calculated for Landsat/Sentinel images before the fire (pre-fire NBR) and after 
the fire (post-fire NBR). The **difference between the pre-fire NBR and the post-fire NBR** referred 
to as **delta NBR (dNBR)** is computed to highlight the areas of forest disturbance by fire event. 

Classification of the dNBR is be used for burn severity assessment, as areas with higher dNBR 
values indicate more severe damage whereas areas with negative dNBR values might show increased 
vegetation productivity. dNBR is classified according to burn severity ranges proposed by 
the United States Geological Survey(USGS) 

To compute the above forest fires, click on the calculator icon . This will open up the 
“Calculate Indicators” dialog box.

Compute Mediterrenean Desertification and Land Use (MEDALUS)
_____________________________________________________________

The Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use (MEDALUS) is the name of a project supported 
by Europe to assess, model and understand the desertification phenomena that increasingly 
affect the Mediterranean area. It provides a satisfied result about land degradation vulnerability. 

The MEDALUS approach identifies environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs) through the Environmentally 
Sensitive Area Index (ESAI). This index can be used to obtain an in-depth understanding of the parameters 
causing the desertification threat at a certain point. This approach is simple, robust, widely applicable, 
and acceptable to new indicators and parameters and can be adjusted to several level scales. , the method 
was used for the analysis of the main indicators identified to be driving forces of land degradation. 

.. note::
   Maintain the same area of interest for all computations within MEDALUS.

1. Soil Quality Index (SQI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Soil is a crucial factor in evaluating the Environmental Sensitivity of an ecosystem, especially in the arid, 
semi-arid and dry sub-humid zones. Soil properties related to desertification and degradation phenomena affect two principal parameters:
(i) water storage and retention capacity;
(ii) erosion resistance.
   
The formula used to compute the SQI is as shown below:

**SQI  = (Parent material x Depth x Texture x Slope x Drainage x Rock Fragments)^1/6**

2. Vegetation Quality Index (VQI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Vegetation Quality index is derived as the geometric mean of the characteristics of the vegetation. Fire Hazard layers (RI), 
Fire Resistance (FR), drought (RS), vegetation erosion protection (PE) and cover plant (CV) according to the 
following formula: 

**VQI = (RI x PE x RS x CV) ^ ¼**

Default datasets used for vqi are as shown below:

3. Climate Quality Index (CQI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Climate quality is assessed on the basis of how it influences water availability to the plants. The climate quality index, according to the MEDALUS approach, is obtained by cross-referencing the three layers of 
information namely precipitation and aridity index using the following equation: 

**CQI = (precipitation x aridity index) ^ 1/2**

Default datasets used for CQI are:

+---------------------------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Indicator**                   | **Variables**                  | **Data Source**                                                                                                                                                                      |

   :align: center

Proceed to select an area of interest and run the computation. You will be required to select a destination for your 
output file.

4. Management Quality Index (MQI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Management quality index, according to the MEDALUS approach, is obtained by cross-referencing the two layers of information 
namely Land-Use intensity (LU) and Population Density (PD) using the following equation: 

**MQI = (LU X PD)^1/2**

Default datasets used for MQI are:

+---------------------------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Indicator**                   | **Variables**                  | **Data Source**                                                                                                                                                                      |

+---------------------------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

To compute vegetation quality index, select Management Quality Index option under the MEDALUS toolbar. Select 
the land cover year an and set aggregation definition for Land Use Intensity. This will reclassify land cover classes 
based on definition provided.

output file.

Environmentally sensitive area (ESA) Index (Combined Desertification Layer)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The environmentally sensitive area (ESA) index (ESAI) is computed according to the original procedure as a geometric 
mean of the four quality values recorded at each location (i.e., in each elementary pixel; Equation 2):

**ESAI = (SQI x VQI x CQI x MQI) ^ 1/4**

To compute the final desertification layer all MEDALUS subindicator must be already computed i.e SQI, VQI, CQI, MQI.
In the MEDALUS toolbox select Calculate **final MEDALUS option** as shown below:

Load all 4 layers to the plugin, select the area of interest and compute the ESAI. You will be required to 
select a destination for your output file.

.. note::
   All layers will be automatically loaded into the plugin if they are available and loaded within QGIS.
